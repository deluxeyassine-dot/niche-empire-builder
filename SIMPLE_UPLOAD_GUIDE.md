Look in this folder on your computer:
```
C:\Users\User\.qwen\claude code cla\niche-empire-builder\READY_TO_UPLOAD
```

You should see:
```
📁 READY_TO_UPLOAD/

2. Go to: **https://github.com/deluxeyassine-dot/niche-empire-builder**
3. You should see your repository page

**What you should see:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GitHub                                    [Sign in/Profile] │

│ 📁 Folders and files listed here               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 📂 STEP 3: NAVIGATE TO THE PUBLIC FOLDER

**On the GitHub page:**

1. **LOOK FOR** the list of folders
2. **CLICK** on the folder named **"public"**

**What to click:**
```
📁 public          ← CLICK THIS
📁 src
📄 README.md
```

**After clicking, you'll see:**
```
deluxeyassine-dot / niche-empire-builder / public

List of HTML files:
📄 index.html

## ➕ STEP 4: UPLOAD YOUR FILES

**Now you're in the public folder. Look at the TOP RIGHT:**

1. **FIND** the button that says **"Add file"** (top right corner)
2. **CLICK** "Add file"
3. **CLICK** "Upload files" from the dropdown

**What you should see:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                           [+ Add file ▼]        │← CLICK HERE
│                                                 │
│   Dropdown appears:                             │

│   ⬆ Upload files        ← THEN CLICK THIS      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📤 STEP 5: DRAG AND DROP THE 6 FILES

**After clicking "Upload files", you'll see:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Drag files here to add them to your repository │
│                                                 │
│            [choose your files]                  │
│                                                 │
│ or drag and drop files here                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**TWO WAYS TO UPLOAD:**

### **OPTION A: Drag and Drop (EASIEST)**
1. Open the **READY_TO_UPLOAD** folder on your computer
2. **SELECT ALL 6 FILES** (hold Ctrl and click each file, or Ctrl+A)
3. **DRAG** them into the GitHub upload area
4. **DROP** them

### **OPTION B: Click to Browse**
1. **CLICK** "choose your files"
2. Browse to: `C:\Users\User\.qwen\claude code cla\niche-empire-builder\READY_TO_UPLOAD`

```

## ✍️ STEP 6: ADD A COMMIT MESSAGE

**Scroll down** on the upload page. You'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Commit changes                                  │
│                                                 │
│ [Add complete automation system]  ← Text box    │
│                                                 │
│ [Optional extended description]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**In the text box, TYPE:**
```
Add complete automation system - API keys, video generator, watermark remover, automation control
```

**Leave the second box empty** (it's optional).

## 🚀 STEP 7: COMMIT THE FILES (UPLOAD!)

**At the bottom of the page:**

1. **MAKE SURE** "Commit directly to the main branch" is selected (should be by default)
2. **CLICK** the big green button that says **"Commit changes"**

**What you should see:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚫ Commit directly to the main branch           │← SELECTED
│ ⚪ Create a new branch for this commit          │
│                                                 │
│         [Commit changes]  ← CLICK THIS GREEN BUTTON │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ⏱️ STEP 8: WAIT FOR GITHUB TO PROCESS (30 seconds)

After clicking "Commit changes":

1. GitHub will process your files
2. You'll see a **green checkmark** appear
3. The page will show your uploaded files

**What you should see:**
```
✅ Files committed successfully!

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem 1: "Can't find the public folder"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're on: https://github.com/deluxeyassine-dot/niche-empire-builder
- Look for the folder icon 📁 labeled "public"
- Click it

### Problem 2: "Upload button is grayed out"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're signed in to GitHub
- Check you're in the right repository
- Try refreshing the page (F5)

### Problem 3: "Files didn't upload"
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try uploading files one at a time instead of all 6
- Make sure files are .html files (not .txt or other formats)

### Problem 4: "Vercel not deploying"
**Solution:**
- Wait 5 minutes (sometimes Vercel is slow)
- Go to Vercel dashboard and click "Redeploy"
- Check the deployment logs for errors

### Problem 5: "Page shows 404 error"
**Solution:**
- Make sure files were uploaded to the **public** folder, not the root
- Check file names are exact: `api-keys.html` (not `API-keys.html`)
- Wait a few more minutes for Vercel to finish deploying
